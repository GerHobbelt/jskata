h1. JsKata - simple utils librairies for everyday uses

h2. Manifesto
* *No inner dependence* : don't depend on a "core". Every library can be used independently "as is". Rewrite private functionalities if should.
* *No external dependence* : don't depend on external library
* *Everything is public* : when something is marked _private_ and you use it, it's because you know what you're doing
* *Never touch the dom* : "jQuery":http://jquery.com is doing a wonderful job already
* *Try to avoid objects* : use closures everytime I can
* *No plugin* : if you want to rewrite add functionalities, override it
* *No unnecessary validation* : if something goes wrong, an error will pop
* *If it exists, don't rewrite it* : if someone has already done it in a good way, don't reimplement
* *Write good documentation* : I still have to figure out that one
* *Promote* : A good library is nothing without users
