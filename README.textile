h2. Documentation

Documentation is maintained by hand. I guess there's no better way of doing it.

It is available in the *doc* subfolder.

h2. Manifesto
* *No internal dependence* : every library can be used independently "as is".
* *No external dependence* : don't depend on external libraries.
* *Everything is public* : when something is marked _private_ and you use it, it's because you know what you're doing
* *Never touch the dom* : "jQuery":http://jquery.com already exists for that
* *No unnecessary validation* : if something goes wrong, an error will pop
* *No error catching* : if an error pop, it goes all the way up
* *Avoid objects* : use closures
* *No plugins* : if a developer wants to add something, he will find a way around
* *Write good documentation* : document as I code
* *Promote* : a good library is nothing without users
